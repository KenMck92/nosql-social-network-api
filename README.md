# nosql-social-network-api

## Description
In this NoSQl project I created seed files to seed date into a file that can be seeded into insomnia. I also created routes to GET, PUT and Delete data from friends, thoughts, user and reactions that were seeded to the database. When the user is insomnia they can view all users, view all reactions, view all thoughts, add and delete users, add and delete reactions that are linked to users by a reactions ID. Friends can be added or deleted to users specified by that users thought ID. Searching for friends, reactions, users and thoughts can be completed using the correct URL and API to those specific areas of the seed data.
